# About us

Wyll is a pure player, fully independent, a real Hub in Occitania on topics related to ecosystems **DevOps** and **Cloud** !

This team of passionate **Toulouse** residents is convinced that today, a DevOps approach is inseparable from an opening towards the CLOUD of certain services in a context where DATA processing is increasingly complex.
This is why we support our customers on these 3 axes and explain at the same time, projects/developments/training/certifications to our experts on the entirety of this perimeter.

Wyll - it's above all a bunch of tech buffs yes... BUT NOT ONLY!

For us, a good quality of life pro/personal goes through time spent on other passions:
#jeudego #hiking #climbing #curling #guitar #couture #ski #motorcycle #mcdo #oenology
Besides, we finance your passions (yes... ALL your passions... even pizzas)!

Around a coffee, a foam or on the slack you can also hear about lighter topics...
#switch, #OSS117, #Kaamelott, #quantum physics, #cotedeboeuf #aperitif #belote #jaunededamas #untrainpourpau #kohlanta

Pour as much, on strong bump too. At Wyll, one is able to use the Prune üê≥ Docker system (even if it is immature), or even transfer their existing domain name registration to Amazon Route 53 without disrupting their existing web traffic (nor the Route 66 by the way).

Wyll intervenes throughout the DevOps chain with an end-to-end approach from the upstream phase with the creation of POCs, through project management in Agile mode and application development (backend, frontend, fullstack and Big Data ) to the automation of tests, automation of integration and deployment as well as the phases of operability (OPS) and dematerialization of infrastructures (Infra As A Code & Cloud).

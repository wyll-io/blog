In this article, you will learn a very basic example of how to build, test and deploy a Golang application into the Docker Hub. To do so we will use the Github Actions.

# The Golang application

Let's create a very basic Web application with Golang that will sum two integers and display the result into the browser.

```go
package main

import (
  "fmt"
  "log"
  "net/http"
)

func handler(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
  fmt.Fprintf(w, sum(1,2))
}

func sum(a, b int) int {
  return a + b
}

func main() {
  http.HandleFunc("/", handler)
  log.Fatal(http.ListenAndServe(":8000", nil))
}
```

This very simple application will basically print `Hello World` on a Web page.

# Do not forget the tests

Let's write some basic tests for the `sum()` function.

```go
tests()
```

# Deploy it !

```yaml
name: Build and deploy

on:
  push:

jobs:
  push_to_registry:
    name: Push Docker image to Docker Hub
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Check out the repo
        uses: actions/checkout@v2
      
      - name: Log in to Docker Hub
        uses: docker/login-action@v1
        with:
          username: ${{ secrets.DOCKER_USERNAME }}
          password: ${{ secrets.DOCKER_PASSWORD }}
      
      - name: Extract metadata (tags, labels) for Docker
        id: meta
        uses: docker/metadata-action@v3
        with:
          images: fallais/example-docker-hub
      
      - name: Build and push Docker image
        uses: docker/build-push-action@ad44023a93711e3deb337508980b4b5e9bcdc5dc
        with:
          context: .
          push: true
          tags: ${{ steps.meta.outputs.tags }}
          labels: ${{ steps.meta.outputs.labels }}
```

# A cloud without cloud provider, it's possible ?

In this article I will present the Openstack cloud solution, which allows to have a real cloud system in your company. 

## A cloud is in every mouth today

In the current context, most companies are wondering about their information systemâ€™s migration to the cloud. Several blocking points may arise in particular in the fact of having its data hosted in cloud providers type GAFAM (like GCP and AWS), themselves subject to the patriotism act.
It is of course possible to use French cloud providers, such as OvhCloud or Scaleway for example, but here again the problem of transferring its data to a private partner. 

##  But what to do?

it's quite possible to have your own cloud system within your company, this allows you to use different concepts and technologies, it also allows you to pool resources. The most popular cloud systems known in the world is Openstack!!!

## What's Openstack ?

To present Openstack, we will go back in time to 2010. Openstack is an open-source cloud computing system born from the collaboration between NASA and the hosting provider Rackspace Hosting.

The goal of this project is to provide cloud-based resources and services on standardized hardware.

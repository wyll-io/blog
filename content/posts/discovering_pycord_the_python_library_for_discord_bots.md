# Discovering Pycord: The Python Library for Discord Bots
At Wyll, we recently adopted Discord as our enterprise messaging platform, 
opening up the door to developing a variety of bots tailored to our specific 
needs. As a Python enthusiast, I naturally sought out Python libraries capable 
of interfacing with the Discord API. My initial exploration led me to Discord.py, 
a widely used library that offers a straightforward development experience. However, 
after realizing its limitations in implementing slash commands, I embarked on a quest 
for an alternative. My search ultimately brought me to Pycord, a fork of Discord.py 
that introduces modern features such as asynchronous programming and improved rate 
limiting control.
## What Is Pycord ?
Pycord is an open-source Python library specifically designed to interact with the 
Discord API. It offers well-documented, comprehensive features for developing powerful 
and customizable Discord bots. With Pycord, you can create bots to perform various 
tasks, such as member management, message broadcasting, data collection, and much more. 
An additional advantage is its native implementation of slash commands, which I will 
demonstrate in the tutorial.
## Why Choose Pycord ?
Pycord swiftly captured my attention due to its user-friendly development process, 
extensive feature support, and thriving community. It served as the ideal foundation 
for creating our Discord bot, WOOP, meticulously designed to manage seating arrangements 
and lunch reservations within our open office space. WOOP's seamless integration with 
Discord has streamlined our daily operations, making it an invaluable asset to our team.

Why choose Pycord, among the numerous libraries available for Discord bot development? 
Here are a few compelling reasons that make it an excellent choice:
### 1. User-Friendly
Pycord is known for its user-friendliness. Developers appreciate its comprehensive 
documentation and clear guides, making it easy even for beginners to create Discord 
bots quickly. The [API](https://docs.pycord.dev/en/stable/api/index.html) is intuitive, reducing the time required to set up your bot. 
As the icing on the cake, its [repository](https://github.com/Pycord-Development/pycord/tree/v2.4.1/examples) 
offers a variety of sample features from which to draw inspiration.
### 2. Active Community
Pycord has an active and engaged community. You can find forums, Discord servers, and online 
resources to get help and advice. The library is continuously evolving, with frequent updates 
adding new features and improving stability.
### 3. Customization
Pycord allows you to customize your Discord bot endlessly. You can add custom commands, 
create automatic responses, and develop unique features for your server. The only limit is 
your creativity.
### 4. Performance
Pycord is designed to be performant. Thanks to its efficient architecture, your Pycord bots 
can handle large communities effortlessly. The library is also compatible with the latest 
Python versions, ensuring optimal performance.

## How to Get Started with Pycord?
To get started with Pycord, here are the basic steps:
### Step 1: Prerequisites
Before you begin, make sure you have Python installed on your system. You will also need a 
Discord account and administrative rights on a Discord server to add your bot. Personally, 
for practical reasons, I created my own Discord server. It's free, so why not? Thanks to it, 
I was able to test all my developments almost instantly.
### Step 2: Create a Discord Application
1. Go to the Discord Developer Portal. 
2. Enter your username and password if you are not already logged in to Discord. 
3. Click “Login”
4. Click on "New Application" to create a new application.
5. Give your application a name; this name will also be your bot's name. 
6. Click "Create" to confirm.
### Step 3: Create a Bot
1. In the settings of your new application, select "Bot" from the left menu.
2. Click "Add Bot" to create a bot for your application.
3. You can customize your bot's avatar and give it a username.
### Step 4: Get the Bot Token
In the "Token" section of the bot's page, click "Copy" to copy your bot's token. Keep this token confidential. Do not share it with anyone, and never publish it online.
### Step 5: Create virtual environment
Before to get start to develop your project, I advise you to create a virtual environment with the venv module
Open your terminal and run the following command to create a virtual environment

    python3 -m venv .env_bot

Then, for activate this virtual environment, run:

    source .env_bot/bin/activate

### Step 6: Install Pycord
For install Pycord, run: 

    pip install py-cord

### Step 7: Create the project directory
Run:

    mkdir my_first_bot

Go to the directory:

    cd my_first_bot
### Step 8: Python Code for Your Bot
Create a Python file, for example, bot.py, and open it in your favorite code editor. Then, add the following code to configure and run your bot:
```Python
from discord import Intents, Bot, ApplicationContext

# Create an instance of the bot
bot = Bot(description="This is my first bot", intents=intents)

# Startup event
@bot.event
async def on_ready():
    print(f'Connected as {bot.user}')

# Test slash command
@bot.slash_command(
    description="Slash command description",
    name="hello"
)
async def hello(ctx: ApplicationContext):
    await ctx.respond(f"Hello {ctx.author.nick}")

# Start the bot with the token
bot.run('YOUR_BOT_TOKEN_HERE')
```

Make sure to replace `YOUR_BOT_TOKEN_HERE` with the token you copied in Step 4.
### Step 9: Run Your Bot
Run your Python script using the following command in the terminal:

    python bot.py

Your Discord bot should now connect and be ready to respond to the `/hello` 
command that we defined in our example.
That's it! You've created a basic Discord bot using Pycord. 
You can now customize and extend your bot's features to meet the needs of 
your Discord server. To learn more about Pycord's features and creating more 
advanced bots, check out the official Pycord documentation. Happy coding!
